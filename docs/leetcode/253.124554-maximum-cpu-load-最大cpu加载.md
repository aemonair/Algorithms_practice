#### 最大CPU加载
We are given a list of Jobs. Each job has a Start time, an End time, and a CPU load when it is running. Our goal is to find the maximum CPU load at any time if all the jobs are running on the same machine.

Example 1:

Jobs: `[[1,4,3], [2,5,4], [7,9,6]]`
Output: 7
Explanation: Since [1,4,3] and [2,5,4] overlap, their maximum CPU load (3+4=7) will be when both the
jobs are running at the same time i.e., during the time interval (2,4).
Example 2:

Jobs: `[[6,7,10], [2,4,11], [8,12,15]]`
Output: 15
Explanation: None of the jobs overlap, therefore we will take the maximum load of any job which is 15.
Example 3:

Jobs: `[[1,4,2], [2,4,1], [3,6,5]]`
Output: 8
Explanation: Maximum CPU load will be 8 as all jobs overlap during the time interval [3,4].

For _n_ tv channels, given show start time, end time & bandwidth needed for each channels, find the maximum bandwidth required at peak. a show represented as [1,30,2] meaning [show-start-time, show-end-time, bandwidth-needed].
```
_e.g. n =3 channels,

[ [1,30, 2],[31,60, 4],[61,120, 3],
[1,20,2],[21,40,4],[41,60,5],[61,120,3],
[ 1,60,4 ],[ 61,120,4 ] ]

Ans: 13, for time slot between 41-60 each channel need 4,5,4 bandwidth respectively. 13 is highest (peek/max) bandwidth.
```
Note

-   Min-size-of-show = 2 (min)
-   Max-duration-for-show = 720 (min) same as 24hours
-   Max-bandwidth-per-show = 100 (mbps)
-   n<1000
-   Some channels can decide not to broadcast any show for given time-slot, which mean there will be 0 bandwidth required for that channel for given time-slot.

1. 上下车问题，使用对应的cpuload; start+ end- ;
2. 使用minHeap，堆中存放对应的任务；并计算current的最大值；若堆顶.end < job.start,则出堆；
```cpp
    int findMaxCPULoad(std::vector<Job>& jobs)
    {
        std::vector<std::vector<int>> job_load;
        for(auto job: jobs) {
            job_load.push_back(std::vector<int>{job.start, job.cpuload});
            job_load.push_back(std::vector<int>{job.end  ,-job.cpuload});
        }

        std::sort(job_load.begin(), job_load.end());
        int max = 0, current = 0;
        for(auto job : job_load){
            current += job[1];
            max = std::max(max, current);
        }
        return max;
	}
 ```


```cpp
    int findMaxCPULoad1(std::vector<Job>& jobs)
    {
        // minheap 以结束时间排序在pq中，用于先结束先出堆
        auto cmp = [](Job &a, Job &b) -> bool {return a.end < b.end;};
        std::priority_queue<Job, std::vector<Job>, decltype(cmp)> queue(cmp);
        std::sort(jobs.begin(), jobs.end(), [](Job &a, Job &b){return a.start < b.start;});
        int max = 0;
        int current = 0;
        for(auto job: jobs) {
            while(!queue.empty() && queue.top().end < job.start){
                current -= queue.top().cpuload;
                queue.pop();
            }
            queue.push(job);
            current += job.cpuload;
            max = std::max(max, current);
        }

        return max;
    }
```
